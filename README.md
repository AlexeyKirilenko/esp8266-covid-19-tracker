This tutorial shows how to interface ESP8266 NodeMCU (ESP-12E) board with ILI9341 TFT display.
The ILI9341 TFT module contains a display controller with the same name: ILI9341. It’s a color display that uses SPI interface protocol and requires 4 or 5 control pins, it’s low cost and easy to use.
The resolution of this TFT display is 240 x 320 which means it has 76800 pixels. This module works with 3.3V only and it doesn’t support 5V (not 5V tolerant).

TFT: Thin-Film Transistor.
SPI: Serial Peripheral Interface.

### Project Hardware Required:

NodeMCU board
ILI9341 TFT display module (2.2″, 2.4″, 2.8″ …)
Micro USB cable (for programming and powering the whole circuit)
Breadboard
Jumper wires
